# Missing Letters
---
You are supposed to label a bunch of boxes with numbers from 0 to n, and all the labels are stored in the array arr. Unfortunately one of the labels is missing. Your task is to find it.

**Example**
-   missingNumber([3, 1, 0]) should return 2.
-   missingNumber([3, 4, 5]) should return 0.
-   missingNumber([0, 1, 2]) should return 3.

**Hints**
-   sort()
